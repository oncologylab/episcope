\title{JASPAR-like Position Frequency Matrix (PFM) / Position Probability Matrix (PPM) clustering utilities}
\description{
Alignment-based motif similarity using mean column-wise Pearson correlation
across overlaps (direct + reverse-complement). Includes pairwise metrics,
similarity matrix, and hclust + cut-to-K clustering.
}
\details{
Motifs are represented as 4 x L probability matrices (Position Probability Matrix; PPM)
with rows A,C,G,T. Position Frequency Matrices (PFMs; counts) are accepted and
converted to PPM internally.
Per-column correlation is Pearson over 4 values; if sd(v1)==0 OR sd(v2)==0,
correlation is defined as 0 for that column. Alignment offsets are tested
from -(w2-1) to (w1-1) inclusive. Best alignment chosen by:
(1) maximize cor, (2) maximize Ncor, (3) maximize overlap length w.

Normalizations:
  Ncor1 = cor * (w / w1)
  Ncor2 = cor * (w / w2)
  Ncor  = cor * (w / max(w1, w2))
}
