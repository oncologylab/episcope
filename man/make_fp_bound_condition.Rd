\title{Build per-condition FP bound flags (1/0) with score and ATAC overlap gating}
\usage{
make_fp_bound_condition(
  fp_bound_tbl,
  fp_score_tbl,
  atac_overlap_tbl,
  fp_annotation_tbl,
  metadata,
  label_col,
  threshold_fp_score = 2,
  min_samples = 1L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fp_bound_tbl}{Tibble with peak_ID + sample columns (0/1).}

\item{fp_score_tbl}{Tibble with peak_ID + sample columns (numeric).}

\item{atac_overlap_tbl}{Tibble with atac_peak + sample columns (0/1).}

\item{fp_annotation_tbl}{Tibble with fp_peak and atac_peak columns.}

\item{metadata}{Tibble with id and label_col.}

\item{label_col}{Metadata column holding condition labels.}

\item{threshold_fp_score}{Numeric; require fp_score >= threshold to keep bound.}

\item{min_samples}{Integer; minimum number of samples per condition required to flag.}
}
\value{
Tibble with peak_ID + condition columns (0/1). If each condition has
  a single sample, values are taken directly from that sample (no aggregation).
