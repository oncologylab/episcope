\title{Aggregate RNA expression by condition}
\usage{
make_rna_condition(rna_tbl, metadata, label_col, agg_fun = c("mean", "median"))
}
\arguments{
\item{rna_tbl}{Tibble with ensembl_gene_id, HGNC + sample columns.}

\item{metadata}{Tibble with id and label_col.}

\item{label_col}{Metadata column holding condition labels.}

\item{agg_fun}{Aggregate function: "mean" or "median".}
}
\value{
Tibble with ensembl_gene_id, HGNC + condition columns.
  If each condition has a single sample, values are taken directly
  from that sample (no aggregation).
