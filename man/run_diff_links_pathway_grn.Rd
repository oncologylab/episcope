\description{
Minimal helper for `diff_links_filtered`: runs pathway enrichment
  from distinct `gene_key` values per comparison-direction and optionally
  renders pathway subnet HTML plots using existing network plotting utilities.
Minimal pathway enrichment on filtered differential-link files

For each `*_filtered_links_up.csv` / `*_filtered_links_down.csv` under
`diff_links_filtered`, reads distinct `gene_key`, runs Enrichr pathway
enrichment (same DB defaults as later topic-pathway steps), sorts by adjusted
p-value (small to large), and writes a CSV in the same folder.
