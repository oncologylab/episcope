\arguments{
\item{fp_score}{tibble with 'peak_ID' + ATAC id columns (numeric)}

\item{fp_bound}{tibble with 'peak_ID' + ATAC id columns (0/1 or logical)}

\item{fp_annotation}{tibble with motif hits (passed through)}

\item{atac_score}{tibble with 'atac_peak' + ATAC id columns (numeric)}

\item{atac_overlap}{tibble with 'atac_peak' + ATAC id columns (0/1 or logical)}

\item{rna}{tibble with 'ensembl_gene_id','HGNC' + RNA columns (already named by ATAC ids)}

\item{metadata}{tibble with at least an 'id' column; order defines column order}

\item{tf_list}{character vector of TF symbols (passed through)}

\item{motif_db}{optional tibble (passed through)}

\item{label_col}{optional metadata column to carry along as sample labels (e.g. "strict_match_rna" or "cell_stress_type")}

\item{expected_n}{optional integer for info message}

\item{filter_atac_by_fp_annotation}{Logical; if TRUE, subset atac_score/atac_overlap
rows to peaks present in \code{fp_annotation}. Default TRUE.}
